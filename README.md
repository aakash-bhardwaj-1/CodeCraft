# CodeCraft: Technical Skills Evaluation Hub

The development of "CodeCraft: Technical Skills Evaluation Hub" aims to create an integrated platform facilitating comprehensive technical skills assessment for candidates. Within CodeCraft, two distinct systems are crucial. Firstly, an assessment repository allows interviewers to add coding questions with test cases, enabling candidates to demonstrate their coding proficiency in any language. Secondly, the Technical Interview module, integrates real-time collaboration (code sync) between interviewers and candidates. Here, interviewers can view candidate resumes, add personal comments, and scale candidate proficiency in specific skills, like JavaScript proficiency out of 10. User authentication distinguishes between interviewers and candidates, granting interviewers the ability to add coding questions. Candidates can view, solve, and engage in real-time collaboration via a meeting link. Additionally, note-taking for interviewers and evaluation tracking systems are integrated to enhance interview preparation, benefiting both parties.
